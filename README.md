# Cloud Functions (NodeJS)

A gallery of tiny but useful cloud functions to perform some tasks serverless. It's time to go serverless and focus on building cool stuffs. :)


Story
====

As I am a professional software engineer and mostly I worked remotely for companies from around the world. To perform little little tasks for my clients or for my own proejcts, I planned to go serverless. I stopped thinking about deployment of my work.

When I got any ideas, just program it and deploy to cloud (mostly I am using GCP, as I never got a penny billed for what I use there). And most of the cloud platform providers provide free account and every free account gets enough free usage quota for their service. So unless you go public, it's enough for you to deploy your own stuff on cloud.


Why I created this repository?
====

To enlist all the tiny but useful functions written in NodeJS for other programmers. So they can deploy any specific functions as they want and need in their regular life.
